<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    Investment tracker is a platform that allows you to track aspects that affect your investments.
    Investments that share the same risks, factors, regions and groups can be visually distinguished through the generated relationships graphs for each aspect.
    Currently you can add <a href="#" th:href="{/investments/}">investments</a>, <a href="#" th:href="{/factors}">factors</a>, <a href="#" th:href="{/risk}">risks</a>, <a href="#" th:href="{/region}">regions</a> and <a href="#" th:href="{/group}">group</a> them.
</p>
<p>Written in Java using Spring 4, using Neo4J NoSQL graph database for data persistance and D3 visualization javascript API.<br /> Bootstrap and jQuery used in the front end.</p>
<p>This app is primarily meant to be used to log your investments, define them and understand the affects that factors have on your investments.</p>
<p>The particularly interesting aspect of this project was incorporating Neo4J and visualizingthe inherent relationships its defined to hold in interactive graphs in the web app.</p>
