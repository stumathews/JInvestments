<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    Investment tracker is a platform that allows you to track aspects that affect your investments.
    Investments that share the same risks, factors, regions and groups can be visually distinguished through the generated relationships graphs for each aspect.

</p>
<p>Written in C# using ASP.Net MVC 5 using Entity Framework 6 and using MSSQL database for data persistance and D3 visualization javascript API.<br /> Bootstrap and jQuery used in the front end.</p>
